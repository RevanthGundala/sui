# The purpose of this test is to make sure that the dependency graph is correctly read from lock
# files (fast) even if the dependent manifest files have been stripped of their own dependency info
# (which is of course still available in the respective lock files).
#
# The Move.locked file is not generated due to how the test harness works but the graph is correctly
# included in the Move.resolved file. Please note that while dependency graph is correct, the
# resolved graph is missing some information as it includes data from manifest files that are now
# stripped.
