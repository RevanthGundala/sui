Otherwise, please indicate what changed, and\r\nthen add to the Release Notes section as highlighted during the release\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n### Type of Change (Check all that apply)\r\n\r\n- [ ] protocol change\r\n- [x] user-visible impact\r\n- [ ] breaking change for a client SDKs\r\n- [ ] breaking change for FNs (FN binary must upgrade)\r\n- [ ] breaking change for validators or node operators (must upgrade\r\nbinaries)\r\n- [ ] breaking change for on-chain data layout\r\n- [ ] necessitate either a data wipe or data migration\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\nDevelopers trying recently introduced linters might have seen linter\r\nwarnings coming from Sui standard library which are from now on going to\r\nbe suppressed",
